# Final-Project-CIS126
Arduino Code for Final Project | With planning document

Multi-Arduino Communcation project. Will include
- Assembly code for lookup table
- Encryption and Decryption
- Logic LED lighting
- User Authentication

Problem flow.

Enter a user ID code and receive a confirmation (LEDs, flag waving, sound).
If valid return a cipher key
Send the cipher key back, encrypted, and confirm the exchange. This will demonstrate the key was received and the cipher agreed to.

Send the cipher encrypted text from the first Arduino to the second Arduino, where it will be decoded back to plain text and displayed. 

Use some visual display elements, to add to the overall presentation.

In your paper, describe your design, the choices you made and what you did to implement the various sections. 

This is a paper first. The coded is just part of the content.
